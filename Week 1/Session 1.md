This week was our introduction to the WEB701 class, we were introduced to the various tools that we will be using throughout the course to complete our assignments, namely Visual Studio Code, Git and Github. I am somewhat familiar with all of these, although I normally use SourceTree (A GUI app for source control) and BitBucket because it allowed for private repositories. However GitHub now provides free private repositories so I am quite happy to switch for this class.

I already have a github account that I made quite a while ago in order to fork and pull-request a fix for a Unity API that I needed to update to a new version, although I didn't quite know what I was doing and do not remember how I actually did any of it.

The Git workflow always seemed pretty confusing to me, but I have been meaning to learn the actual commands for it as I know how useful it is for team projects, so I am eager to get into that portion of the class.

Setting up Git to work with Visual Studio Code was a little confusing at first as I could not get my files to show up under the Source Control menu, but once I got that figured out everything has been integrated smoothly.
