This past week I have been working a lot with Github, mostly on my own private projects. I have found it to be a very powerful tool that I will most certainly be using more down the line. Using an online learning program introduced to us named learngitbranching.js.org, I was able to get a better understanding of branching, something that I had never used before in the past.

At the end of this week, we got into teams and were tasked with using Github to create a website of our choosing as a group. We had one Git Master who would manage the repository (although in our team we all managed the github collaboratively). Our strategy for approaching the project was to assign each team member a different section of the website (Different pages, css, etc), we created a branch for each of these things so that we would not have any issues while working. Once we had made a change to our branch we would create a pull request and then merge it (assuming that there were no conflicts).
The site we chose to make was a fan-site for cats, which we designed on one of the whiteboards and then translated into html and css (with bootstrap).
